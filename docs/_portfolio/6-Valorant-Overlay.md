From January to February 2026, I worked on an overlay program in c# for Valorant that responds to in game events.

Using the basic functions of c# .NET, i created a borderless window that sits on top of Valorant, checking every half second for a line of pixels matching colors that show up in a specific region 
when the user gets a kill or switches weapons. [github](https://github.com/Catpotato42/valorant-cosmetic-overlay)
