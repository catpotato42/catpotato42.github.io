From May-August 2025, I was the lead programmer on a two person team making a plant based 3d tower defense game in Unreal Engine. I used c++ exclusively instead of the 
built-in blueprint system to develop my understanding of implementing algorithms such as a simple trajectory calculation for a mortar projectile.
