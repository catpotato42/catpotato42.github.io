Welcome to my portfolio! My name is Simon Harrington and I am a current CS major in a transfer program where I spend 3 years studying Computer Science at Whitman College and 
2 studying computer engineering at a different college.

This website was made with Github Pages, Jekyll, and a customized version of the [Basically Basic](https://github.com/mmistakes/jekyll-theme-basically-basic) theme.
